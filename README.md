# Gym-data-cleaning
cleansed personal data

I had read that a big part of a data analyst/scientists job is cleaning messy data. So I decided to learn about various ways to do it, and rather than download a messy dataset online. I happened to have many messy datasets of my own! When I go to the gym I make sure to log all my exercises, weights, reps etc, so that I can look back and can track my progress to see how I've improved. This is my attempt at going through the process of cleaning the data.
These spreadsheets were created in Google sheets were made before I had leanred anything about programming and so are extremely unordered, inconsistent and messy. Perfect for this project!
